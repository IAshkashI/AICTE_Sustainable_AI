Wildfire Area Prediction Model
This project details the development of a machine learning model to predict the total burned area of forest fires. The objective is to create a predictive tool for risk assessment and resource management, utilizing the Forest Fires dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The methodology includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing via log transformation of the skewed target variable (area), one-hot encoding of categorical features, and feature scaling after splitting the data into training and testing sets.
